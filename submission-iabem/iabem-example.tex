 \section{Instructions for preparing abstracts}

   All papers for IABEM 2018 should be written in English and prepared
using the IABEM \LaTeX{} templates. Preparation instructions are given in the file
\textbf{\texttt{iabem-example.tex}}. Please put your text only in the places indicated as the files may be processed automatically. You will also require the macros file, \textbf{\texttt{iabem-macros.tex}}, that specifies the layout. The length of your abstract must be  \textbf{at most one  page} including bibliographical references.  
References should be given at the end of the paper in a \texttt{thebibliography} environment and without using bibtex. Citations are inserted using the \texttt{\textbackslash{}cite} command, such as \cite{c1,c2,c3}.
