% THE MAIN TEXT GOES HERE 

The atomic-scale structure of fluids at the solid-liquid interface
plays central roles in problems ranging from understanding proteins to
improving battery technology. This poses serious challenges for
quantitative modeling: on one hand, classical continuum models fail to
reproduce known facts even qualitatively correctly; on the other hand,
for many problems, atomistically detailed models are impractically
expensive. Most approaches for addressing this multiscale problem rely
either on complicated partial differential equation models, or on
coupling atomistic and continuum models. However, existing approaches
have failed to capture key nonlinear phenomena in the first layer of
fluid molecules. Using the electrostatic response of a liquid
surrounding a charged biomolecule as an example, we propose a new
approach, which capitalizes on the well-known fact that
boundary-integral equations focus attention on the interface itself,
and in particular on the transmission
conditions\cite{Bardhan14_asym,MolaviTabrizi16}. We have shown that
the transmission condition associated with the classical continuum
model, based on macroscopic dielectric theory, is easily corrected
with a simple nonlinear term that is a function of the local electric
field~\cite{Bardhan14_asym}.  We call this the solvation-layer
interface condition (SLIC) model.  In this talk, we will discuss
solution existence and uniqueness, as well as numerical methods. The
corrected model treats a boundary-integral equation at the
solid-liquid interface, is easy to compute numerically on complicated
geometries, as it represents merely a diagonal perturbation of the
usual BEM problem, combined with a short nonlinear
iteration~\cite{Bardhan14_asym,MolaviTabrizi16}.  Results illustrate
that this remarkably simple correction to a familiar continuum model
increases accuracy to the level of fully atomistic calculations
thousands of times more expensive, and achieves this accuracy while
reducing the number of model parameters by an order of magnitude.  A
variety of related problems in interfacial response lead to modified
transmission conditions, and we suggest that the boundary-element
method community has a myriad of opportunities to advance multiscale
modeling.
