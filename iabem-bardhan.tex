% THE MAIN TEXT GOES HERE 

The atomic-scale structure of fluids at the solid-liquid interface
plays central roles in problems ranging from understanding proteins to
improving battery technology. This poses serious challenges for
quantitative modeling: on one hand, classical continuum models fail to
reproduce known facts even qualitatively correctly; on the other hand,
for many problems, atomistically detailed models are impractically
expensive. Most approaches for addressing this multiscale problem rely
either on complicated partial differential equation models, or on
coupling atomistic and continuum models. However, existing approaches
have failed to capture key nonlinear phenomena in the first layer of
fluid molecules. Using the electrostatic response of a liquid
surrounding a charged biomolecule as an example, we propose a new
approach, which capitalizes on the well-known fact that
boundary-integral equations focus attention on the interface itself,
and in particular on the transmission
conditions\cite{Bardhan14_asym,MolaviTabrizi16}. We have shown that
the transmission condition associated with the classical continuum
model, based on macroscopic dielectric theory, is easily corrected to
achieve atomistic-model accuracy with a simple nonlinear term that is
a function of the local electric field~\cite{Bardhan14_asym}. The
resulting model is both highly accurate, and also easy to compute
numerically on complicated geometries; it represents merely a diagonal
perturbation of the usual BEM problem, combined with a short nonlinear
iteration~\cite{Bardhan14_asym,MolaviTabrizi16}. A variety of related
problems in interfacial response lead to modified transmission
conditions, and we suggest that the boundary-element method community
has a myriad of opportunities to advance multiscale modeling.
